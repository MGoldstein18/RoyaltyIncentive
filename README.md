This contract inherits from the ERC721A standard and adds functionality to allow a seller of an NFT to set a price and enforce royalty payment. The buyer of the NFT pays the royalty, which is split between the creator and the previous sellers of the NFT. The previous sellers receive royalties in proportion to the percent of total sales volume for that NFT that their sale represents.
